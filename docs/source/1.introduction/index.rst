The **Africa–Europe Energy Transition OSeMOSYS (AETOS)** model is a 
multi-country, open-source energy system model that explores 
long-term energy pathways and trade between Africa and Europe.  
It extends and integrates the **OSeMBE (Europe)** and **TEMBA (Africa)** 
frameworks, providing the most detailed representation to date of 
cross-continental interconnections.

Overview
--------

AETOS is designed to analyze how Africa and Europe can transition toward 
net-zero energy systems while considering electricity, natural gas, 
and hydrogen trade. The model enables researchers, policymakers, and 
analysts to explore scenarios that capture infrastructure investments, 
policy pathways, and sustainability targets across **78 countries**.

Key Features
------------

- **Geographic coverage**: 48 African countries and 30 European countries (incl. Finland, UK, Switzerland).  
- **Time horizon**: 2021–2055 annual analysis.  
- **Energy trade representation**: Grid interconnectors, natural gas pipelines, LNG infrastructure.
